## Description
This project implements a **progressive texture** loading system designed to minimize lag and frame drops during texture loading by loading textures incrementally in blocks of pixels. It enables textures to be loaded incrementally in a way that approaches **asynchronous behavior**, without blocking the main thread.

Originally developed for **Unity** (with plans for future support on ***Unreal Engine***), this system targets all major platforms including *Desktop* (Windows, Linux, macOS), *Mobile* (iOS, Android), and mixed reality (MR) *Headsets* (Quest, Hololens, ..).

This approach is especially crucial for large-scale projects and real-time applications such as **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Virtual Reality (VR)**, where maintaining smooth performance and responsiveness is essential. By progressively loading textures, the system prevents noticeable hitches and ensures a seamless user experience, even with high-resolution or numerous textures.

> ðŸ”— This repository focuses on the **native C++ side** of the texture loading system.  
> It is meant to be used alongside a separate repository that contains the **managed C# layer for Unity integration**, which handles runtime communication, lifecycle management, and higher-level texture API access within the Unity engine.
